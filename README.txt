In this project, we have created a marks-taking application based on Hogwarts School, primarily in the Griffindor house.
Assets, connections, Javascript, and styles are grouped into folders, as each has several files that are crucial for their operation. The other files have their names and functions clearly explained.
The index displays the project architecture.
The most important thing to be able to use the application is that you can create two databases with the names "GriffindorHouse_1.sql" and "userlist.sql". You can download them at this link https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14mv_1VbowM6vOxY91en_8R34r_5dW_X0?usp=sharing
Once you have them, you can view and test our application with all its functionalities.
